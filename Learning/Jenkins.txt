Jenkins 
WebHooks
Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that notify Jenkins when specific events occur in your version control repository. These events typically include code pushes, pull requests, or branch creations. Jenkins can listen for these events and trigger pipeline builds automatically, ensuring that your CI/CD process stays up to date with code changes.
